//! Whole repositories, each provoking one build-system rule.
//!
//! The `reject/` corpus builds every case as a single-package binary with no
//! dependencies, so nothing in it can express a diagnostic *about the graph* —
//! which is most of what the build system checks. Each case here is instead a
//! small repository checked in whole, with a manifest naming what the CLI does
//! in it and what that must print. See `harness/case.rs` for the format.
//!
//! One test per specification document, so cargo runs them on separate threads
//! and a failure names the document to open.
//!
//! ```text
//! BURI_BLESS=1 cargo test -p buri --test repos    # record the goldens
//! BURI_KEEP=1  cargo test -p buri --test repos    # keep the scratch trees
//! ```
